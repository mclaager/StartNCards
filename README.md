# Start N Cards
--------------------
A simple [Rounds](https://landfall.se/rounds) mod to configure the amount of cards that you start with.

This is made as an addon for Pykess' [Pick N Cards](https://github.com/pdcook/PickNCards), and thus shares the same compatibility with mods as Pick N Cards does.
